## KitchenSink

### Introduction

KitchenSink is a standalone program which combines multiple demos in one executable. The purpose of KitchenSink is to
demonstrate the capabilities and functionality of the CopperSpice libraries. These demos are basic examples and the
code is intentionally simplistic and not optimized.


### Building

KitchenSink prebuilt binaries are available for Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows.

https://download.copperspice.com/kitchensink/binary/

To build KitchenSink from source a current copy of the CopperSpice libraries, a C++17 compiler, and a C++17 standard
library are required.

CMake build files are provided with the KitchenSink source distribution.


###### OpenSSL

If you are using a version of CopperSpice which has OpenSSL enabled the OpenSSL library files must be copied to your
KitchenSink deployment folder or available in your path.
